    <h2>To You I Promise</h2>
    <p>By Danny Blackburn </p>
    <p>My love for you is unconditional and enduring.<br>
        To you I promise to always be reassuring.</p>
        
        <p>My love for you protects you and is honorable.<br>
        To you I promise to always be faithful.</p>
        
        <p>My love for you is understanding and passionate.<br>
        To you I promise to always be compassionate.</p>
        
        <p>  My love for you is thoughtful and cherishing.<br>
        To you I promise to always be devoted and caring.
        
        <p>  My love for you is patient and kind.<br>
        To you I promise this always until the end of time.</p>
        
        <p>  <em>My love for you is selfless and forgiving.<br>
        To you I promise this always, for as long as I am living.</em></p>
        <!-- This shows how someone can put their wife first for as long as they are alive. This reminds me of myself.-->
        
        <p>  My love for you is devoted and encouraging.<br>
        To you I promise to always listen and never be detouring.</p>
        
        <p> I promise to show you, my wife, that I love you in all that I do.<br>
        I can promise these things because with all of my heart I love you.</p>
